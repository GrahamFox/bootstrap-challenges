#BOOTSTRAP

Challenge: Creating Your First Web Page with Bootstrap
Let's walk through our very first page design, using Bootstrap. At the end of this tutorial, you will have made a HTML file that displays the "Hello world" message in your web browser.

Open up Sublime (code text editor we have previously downloaded).
Begin by entering the following code and save it as "boot.html".
editor

The only notable difference from the above example that you may see is in the styling of the text. In the above code, you have added the bootstrap CSS in the header (bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css) and two scripts at the end of the body tag. Now, you are ready to use bootstrap, and this is just the beginning!

Part A

Let us continue from Challenge 1, and create a row with a 3-column layout. Each column will contain a heading (<h2>) and a paragraph (<p>), similar to the graphic shown below:

3 columns

Note: When you are making mockup sites, you donâ€™t want to be typing random content just to fill a paragraph tag. Lorem ipsum... is a standard text for adding as a placeholder before the content is ready. Sublime has a shortcut for using this. In Sublime, simply type lorem and press the tab key. Instant Lorem ipsum text should appear, similar to that shown below:
"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum."

Part B

Following on from Part A and underneath the 3-column layout, add another row with a 4-column layout. Use the horizontal rule (<hr>) tag to separate the rows, as shown below:

4 columns

Part C

Continue the challenge by adding a row with a 2-column layout, and another with a 1-column layout, underneath the previous parts as shown below:

multi columns

This challenge has shown you how you can use Bootstrap to build row upon row of content. This creates the page layout in terms of rows and columns and demonstrates the Grid System at work. The building of layouts in this manner is very powerful for rapidly designing page layouts.

Note: This is the most important concept to grasp when using Bootstrap. If you are still unsure about how Grids function, go back to the challenge and experiment with more layouts until you are comfortable with the process.
